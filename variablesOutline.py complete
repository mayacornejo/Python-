a = "Nino
a = True 
a = [1,2,3,4]
#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:

varA = 1
vara = 3

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:
a = 7
print(a)
a = 8

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:
var = 4
var = 'string'

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:
list = ['a','b','c']
print(list[b])

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first
#character in that string:
string = 'Maya'


#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:
print(list)
print(5)

#8)
